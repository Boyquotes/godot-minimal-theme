# Godot Minimal Theme

## Installation

1. Download the `minimal_theme.tres` file of the [latest version](https://github.com/passivestar/godot-minimal-theme/releases/latest).
2. Open `Editor Settings -> Interface -> Theme` and choose the downloaded file in the `Custom Theme` field. You'll need to have `Advanced Settings` enabled to see that field.
3. Click `Save & Restart`.

## Recommended settings

As of **2.0** this theme supports editor settings so you can experiment and choose whatever values you like!

Here are my personal recommendations:

`Editor Settings -> Interface -> Theme`:

- Base Color: `#252525` or `#22262B`
- Accent Color: `#569eff`
- Contrast: `0.2-0.3`
- Icon Saturation: `2`
- Corner Radius: `4-5`

`Editor Settings -> Interface -> Editor`:

- Main Font: [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/)

## Compatibility

This theme was tested with Godot 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5

- The idea for embedding theme generation code into the resource to support editor settings was suggested by [Yuri Sizov](https://github.com/YuriSizov). You can read his article about it [here](https://humnom.net/thoughts/6765836d-make-smarter-editor-themes-in-godot.html).
