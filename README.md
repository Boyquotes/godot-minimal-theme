# Godot Minimal Theme

## Installation

1. Download the `minimal_theme.tres` file of the [latest version](https://github.com/passivestar/godot-minimal-theme/releases/latest).
2. Open `Editor Settings -> Interface -> Theme` and choose the downloaded file in the `Custom Theme` field.
3. Click `Save & Restart`.

## Recommended settings

As of **2.0** this theme supports editor settings so you can experiment and choose whatever values you like!

Here are my personal recommendations:

`Editor Settings -> Interface -> Theme`:

- Base Color: `#252525` or `#22262B`
- Accent Color: `#569eff`
- Contrast: `0.2-0.3`
- Icon Saturation: `2`
- Corner Radius: `4-5`

`Editor Settings -> Interface -> Editor`:

- Main Font: [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/)

## Compatibility

This theme was tested with Godot 4.3 and 4.4. Latest Godot version is recommended because Godot always evolves in terms of what can be themed. Some of the PRs were opened by me to help this theme reach its full potential.

## Credits

- The idea for embedding theme generation code into the resource to support editor settings was suggested by [Yuri Sizov](https://github.com/YuriSizov). You can read his article about it [here](https://humnom.net/thoughts/6765836d-make-smarter-editor-themes-in-godot.html).
